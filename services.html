				<h2>Piano Tuning</h2>
				<!-- Ask Charles for photos of a piano tuning and restoration in progress -->
				<img src="images/grand.jpg" alt="piano tuning" />
				<p>
					When a piano is tuned, the strings are tightened until the
					wire strings are in tune with each other. There are also a
					number of moving parts which work together so the hammers
					will strike the strings properly and effectively. These
					parts may also need adjustment in order for the keys to play
					smoothly and perform according to factory specifications.
					This is called regulation.
				</p>

				<h2>Voicing</h2>
				<img src="images/voicing.jpg" alt="hammer voicing" />
				<p>
					Hammer voicing is almost as import as tuning. The hammer is
					the felt object which strikes the string to produce a tome.
					Depending on the condition of the piano, the piano may sound
					too loud, too bright and too harsh. Another hammer issue can
					be unevenness from one not to the next. This happens because
					most players play certain notes more than others The more
					often played notes get louder than the ones less often
					played.
				</p>
				<p>
					The rememdy for this situation is called hammer voicing. It
					is done by filing off a layer of the hammer or altering the
					density of the hammer with a voicing tool. Voicing is
					relatively inexpensive or in some cases minor voicing is
					included with the price of the tuning.
				</p>
				<p>
					As a pianist of both classical and popular music, I have a
					hands-on understanding of the variable tones which can be
					created and improved upon.

			<!-- ask Charles about paragraph three on the voicing page. Does it really need to be included here? -->

				<h2>Piano Repair and Restoration</h2>

				<p>
					Pianos sometimes need repair of broken or worn out parts.
					Estimates on repair are throughly expained and discussed
					with the customer before the work begins.
