					<h2>Welcome</h2>
					<p>
						Thank you for visiting my website. I have been a piano
						tuner and rebuilder since 1976. With over forty years of
						experience, I will be able to take care of all of your
						pianos' needs. I have apprenticed in piano rebuilding
						shops in New York City, attended the Steinway factory
						school and am a proud member of the
						<a class="inline" href="http://www.ptg.org/"
							>Piano Technician's Guild</a
						>.
					</p>

					<p>
						<!-- I need charles to type out the names of these towns. -->
						I am able to serve customers throughout the Greater
						Memphis Metropolitan area including, Germantown,
						Cellreville, Marion, Blytheville and Osceola.
					</p>

					<p>
						I also serve Northwest Arkansas. To visit my Bentonville
						site, click

					<h2>What My Customers Have to Say</h2>
					<figure>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								"Charles Gage has serviced my piano for several
								years to my highest satisfaction. He also tunes
								the piano for my church where I am the music
								director.
							</p>

							<p>
								Because I completely trust his skills and his
								judgement, I have recommended him to all of my
								piano students. What sets Charles apart are not
								just his skills, his level of experience, his
								integrity and his dedication - but also his high
								level of pianistic skills and musicianship.
							</p>
							<p>
								I recommend Charles Gage without any
								reservation."
							</p>
